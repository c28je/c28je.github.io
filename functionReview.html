<div>
	function is an action, you can put things inside of it. Wen you "call it" or "run it" it does the things.
	<br><br>
	You can define and specify what your function does so that id does specific things (like changing specific traits or characteristics of an element on the page)
	<br><br>
	Sometimes we want to run a fucntion on the whole document we say document.__... when we want to do this with a div we say its's id the it's style and then the atribute to change -- we usually put these things inside themselves (e.g. box.style.opacity = "0")

<script type="text/javascript">
	
	addEventListener()
	setInterval("click", function (){}) // makes a function run every time interval you set//

	createElement() //makes a div or link or whatver you ask to make it//

	classList.add() // adds a class to a element we've created//

	console.log()
	alert()

	play() //plays an audio file - use audio file id//
	pause() //pause an audio file - use audio file id//
